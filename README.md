# VS-Code-Frontend
This is one of my early assignments completed during my MERN stack learning journey. The project is built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on:  Page structure (header, main content, footer)  Responsive layout basics  Styling elements with CSS  ðŸ”° I created this to strengthen my frontend foundation before diving deeper into JavaScript and React.
